# StreamRHF Implementation

This is a Python implementation of the StreamRHF algorithm for anomaly detection in data streams.
The code is based on the following papers:

- STREamRHF: Tree-Based Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Data Streams by Nesic, Stefan and Putina, Andrian and Bahri, Maroua and Huet, Alexis and Navarro, Jose Manuel and Rossi, Dario and Sozio, Mauro. 
- Random Histogram Forest for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection by Putina, Andrian and Sozio, Mauro and Rossi, Dario and Navarro, Jos√© Manuel.

The code was inspired by the official implementation of both papers which can be found at https://github.com/stefannesic/streamRHF and https://github.com/anrputina/rhf.

To use it you need to have the following libraries installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tqdm
- joblib

Have the data in ../data/public/. (You may change this path in the code)
Have a folder ./results/ to save the results. (You may change this path in the code)

to run the code use the following command:
python streamRHF.py dataset1 dataset2 dataset3 ...

where dataset1, dataset2, dataset3, ... are the names of the datasets to be processed. They shuld be in the ../data/public/ folder.
